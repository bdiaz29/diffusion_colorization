# Diffusion Colorization

*Bringing historical black-and-white photographs back to life with modern diffusion models*

---

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the power of diffusion models for intelligent image colorization. Using the same generative technology behind state-of-the-art image synthesis, our approach infers realistic and historically plausible color palettes for monochrome photographs.

The animated demonstrations below showcase the progressive colorization process, revealing how diffusion models gradually build up color information while preserving the original photograph's texture, lighting, and authenticity.

**Classic portrait transformation**: Watch as Albert Einstein's iconic black-and-white photograph is brought to life with natural skin tones, warm lighting, and period-appropriate colors that feel authentic to the original era.

</div>

**Controlled colorization with text prompts**: By specifying *"blue shirt"* in the prompt, the model generates a plausible colorization while maintaining the photograph's emotional impact and historical authenticity. Notice how the system preserves the original's lighting, texture, and film grain.

### Migrant Mother - Red Shirt Variant

</div>

**Demonstrating controllability**: The same photograph colorized with a *"red shirt"* prompt shows how our approach enables creative control while maintaining photographic realism. Each variant produces equally convincing results, showcasing the model's ability to generate multiple plausible colorizations.

## Key Features

- **Progressive diffusion process**: Watch the colorization emerge step-by-step through the denoising process
- **Text-guided control**: Direct specific color choices through natural language prompts
- **Historical authenticity**: Colors that feel appropriate to the photograph's era and context
- **Texture preservation**: Original film grain, lighting, and photographic qualities remain intact
- **Multiple plausible outputs**: Generate different colorization variants for the same image

## Results Showcase

diffusion-based approach produces colorizations that feel natural and historically grounded, avoiding the artificial appearance often associated with traditional colorization methods. The progressive nature of diffusion allows for fine control over the colorization process, resulting in images that honor the original photographer's intent while adding the vibrancy of color.
